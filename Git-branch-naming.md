Name feature branches like: `feature/featurename`

example:
 - `feature/signin`
 - `feature/header`


### Vincent
If we are trying this convention for `feature` branches, following 
the [Vincent](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) 
branching model, we can also name `release` and `hotfix` branch types like
this convention.

example:
 - `release/1.2`
 - `hotfix/foobarbaz`

> **__NOTE__** 
> `release/...` branches are only usable when we decide to develop a released
  version instead of our `master` and changes within the release branch are
  not usable in the future.

### Junk & Try
And also in other conventions, it is said that we can have branches starting
with `junk` and `try` which means these kinds of branches are experiments or
for `R&D` purposes, and will never be merged. It does not follow Vincent's
branching model but what do you think?

example:
- `try/timescaledb`
- `junk/foo`


### Alignment branches
To align two or more projects together, use a branch name 
like: `alignment/python3.14`.

### Refactor
Also, the prefix refactor/<reason> may be useful to show huge changes.

### Purge
To remove some feature or API use `purge`, i.e: `purge/socialnetwork`
